# Snake Game
Snake Game - Made using SFML Library

## Summary
Developed as a mini personal project to practice and refine my C++ skills.

This classic Snake game was built using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), which I found fun to work with after using it in a school project.

Features include responsive controls, increasing challenge as the snake grows, and a clean and simple interface.
